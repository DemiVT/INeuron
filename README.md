# AI-Powered Data Analysis System

## Overview

The **AI-Powered Data Analysis System** is a robust and automated tool designed to streamline the process of data analysis. It integrates data preprocessing, machine learning model training, evaluation, and visualization into a cohesive platform. Users can upload datasets, initiate analyses, and view detailed results through a user-friendly interface. This project leverages Python, Flask, MongoDB, and various libraries to deliver an efficient and scalable data analysis solution.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Upload and process CSV files for analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and split data into training and testing sets.
- **Machine Learning**: Build and evaluate models using linear regression (expandable to other algorithms).
- **Visualization**: Display graphical representations of data and analysis results (optional).
- **API Integration**: Interact with the system through RESTful API endpoints.
- **Database Management**: Store and manage data using MongoDB.

## Architecture

The system architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, consisting of the following components:

1. **User Interface**: The front-end layer where users interact with the system.
2. **RESTful API Layer (Flask)**: Handles HTTP requests and serves as the bridge between the user interface and backend modules.
3. **Data Processing Module**: Manages data ingestion, cleaning, and preparation.
4. **Machine Learning Module**: Responsible for building and evaluating machine learning models.
5. **Visualization Module**: Generates graphical representations of data and results (optional).
6. **Database Integration (MongoDB)**: Manages data storage and retrieval.
7. **Real-Time Data Processing Module**: Handles dynamic data inputs (optional).
8. **Logging Module**: Logs errors and critical information for debugging and monitoring.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system (Python 3.8 or higher recommended).
- **MongoDB**: Install MongoDB and ensure it's running on your local machine or a remote server.

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-powered-data-analysis-system.git
   cd ai-powered-data-analysis-system
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure MongoDB**:
   - Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible.
   - Update the `config.py` file with your MongoDB connection details.

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   - The server will start, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

### API Endpoints

- **Upload Data**:
  - **Endpoint**: `/upload`
  - **Method**: `POST`
  - **Request**: File upload (CSV format)
  - **Response**: Success or failure message

- **Analyze Data**:
  - **Endpoint**: `/analyze`
  - **Method**: `POST`
  - **Request**: JSON data with analysis parameters
  - **Response**: JSON with analysis results and performance metrics

### User Interface

- **Upload Data**: Use the "Upload Data" button to upload your CSV files.
- **Analyze Data**: After uploading, click the "Analyze Data" button to run the analysis.
- **View Results**: Results and visualizations (if enabled) will be displayed in the appropriate sections.
